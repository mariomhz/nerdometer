# Push to GitHub - Step by Step

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open: https://github.com/new
   - (If you don't have an account, create one first at https://github.com/signup)

2. **Fill in the form:**
   - Repository name: `nerdometer` (or any name you like)
   - Description: `80s arcade style nerd quiz`
   - **Important:** Keep it **Public** (required for free Railway deployment)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
   - **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore"
   - **DO NOT** choose a license yet
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **You'll see a page with commands - IGNORE THEM for now**

## Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

On the page you just created, you'll see a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nerdometer.git
```

**Copy this URL!** You'll need it in the next step.

## Step 3: Tell Me Your Repository URL

Once you've created the repository, come back and give me the URL.

It will look like:
- `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nerdometer.git`

Then I'll push your code there!
